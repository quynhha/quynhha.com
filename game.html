        <h3>My Most Recent Work - Tetris </h3>
        <p>I made web-based Tetris as I felt like it is should be a good project to begin to learn html, css and javascript. 
            I managed to make Tetris following the tutorial of Code with Ania Kubow tutorial. From that, I upgraded the game into different mode and
        as well as improved the game to my own liking. If you want to try it, click <a href="./game/Teris/main.html" target="_blank">here</a> or 
        hit the console button down below.</p>

        <h3>Into the Forest</h3>
        <p>by Thi Quynh Ha Nguyen and Forest Welty<br><br>

            “Into the Forest” is about Berry the dog. Berry woke up in the middle of the wood, surrounding by weird noises and darkness. Blending with the noise is the sound of Berry’s stomach growling, he started to wonder around to find his ways home. He soon realized all of this was Chanel the cat - his evil housemate’s plan to eat all of his food. Can you help Berry get home in time for dinner with his growling belly?</p>

                    disappeared until the last 2-days. He said I did the best I could and he would improve it but in the end, we still uploaded my version. Now I really wonder if he did do anything but tbh, I honestly 
                    forget about that problem as I was having the most busy term ever. </span>

        <h3>Multiple Client Chat Program</h3>
        
        <p>This is a multiple client – server chat program which
            follow these requirements:
            <br>- Multiple clients
            <br>- No GUI is needed for the server
            <br>- A simple GUI can be implemented for the server
            <br>- Clients must be able to choose a nickname
            <br>- Clients must be able to “whisper” to each other without having messages displayed to
            other users
            <br>The program was written in Java and Windows socket commands. The design and program are
            modular in nature and make maximum use of abstract data types and of software re-use.
            Particular attention is paid to Client Interface and experience. The report includes the test
            strategies used to verify the correct operation of the program, as well as the entire code. This
            project was developed in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2019.3.4 x64.

        <p>In the remake process<br><br>

            A little game about a Bunny go through stories of her life
            through her dream.
        <br><br> I made this game when I was in grade 12 in Vietnam with no coding experience in 2019. 
        The game was buggy and doesn't seem to have any content now I look back at it. 
        But it is still a proud first product. I have a plan to rebuild it from scratch in 2021 as the game doesn't work anymore on my new machine 
        and I no longer have the data for that project.</p>

        <p>Saucer Shoot is a 2d shoot 'em up where the player controls a space ship that must fight off an endless swarm of invading Saucers. Bullets and explosions provide plenty of mayhem, with a Nuke thrown in for good measure. 
            This is a project for my IMGD3000 class. Making saucer-shoot game with my own updates.

        <h3>Through two ways</h3>
        <p>A mini storytelling game named “Through two ways” about
            a man after the relationship with his girlfriend end. <br>
            I made this game when I was in grade 12 in Vietnam with no coding experience in 2019. 
            This was made after I got accept to my current school to ask for more scholarship. Now I looked back, the game
            is so far from perfect and the story seemed shallow and short and I planed to tell more about it. I will remake it in 2021.
